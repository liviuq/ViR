                Hi! We are a team of two curious individuals who are working together
                to create our first full-fledged website.
                <br>
                Let me present myself as the writer of this document, Andrew. I am a
                21 years old Computer Science student at Al. I. Cuza University in Iasi
                and I like to read science fiction books in my spare time.
                <br>
                My teammate is Marcu Eduard, he likes sleep.
