                Hi! We are a team of two curious Computer Science students at Al. I. Cuza University in Iasi, who are working together
                to create our first full-fledged website.
                <br>
                Let me present myself as the writer of this document, Andrew. I am
                21 years old 
                and I like to read science fiction books in my spare time.
                <br>
                My teammate is Marcu Eduard, he likes sleeping.
